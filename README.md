### Projects ðŸš€
- ðŸ“‘ [StarCoder- May the Source be with you](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cN-b9GnWtHzQRoE7M7gAEyivY0kl4BYs/view) - The StarCoder models are 15.5B parameter models trained on 80+ programming languages from The Stack (v1.2), with opt-out requests excluded. The model uses Multi Query Attention, a context window of 8192 tokens, and was trained using the Fill-in-the-Middle objective on 1 trillion tokens.

- ðŸ“‘ [ECOC based Multi-Class Classification for BCI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9531496) - Developed DNN, under ECOC framework to detect the character out of 40 possibilities that the (disabled) subject wants to communicate via Brain Computer Interface (BCI).

- ðŸ“‘ [Fault-Tolerant Strassen-Like Matrix Multiplication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9302383) - Designed parity calculations to make matrix multiplication calculations, using Strassen-Like algorithms on cloud computing environment (with parallel setting) fault-tolerant.

- ðŸ“‘ [TajGPT and TajBERTo](https://wandb.ai/muhtasham/tajberto/reports/My-learnings-from-training-TajBERTo--VmlldzoyMTEyNDQx) - Developed first ever RoBERTa-like language model based on Tajik language after extensive filtering of the dataset. The model can be used for masked text generation or fine-tune it to a downstream task.
